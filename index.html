            "Right now I have the firm belief that a group of Investors who communicate via Reddit on the r/superstonk subreddit is working to corner the market on the stock ticker GME, known as Gamestop. The effect of which is that the investment in this company should lead to a doubling or more of my money. As these investors are seeking to "prove" malfeasance, is occuring the psychological effect should be an increase in share price over the next two years. An initial run up in price which has lead to a widespread belief that there have been more shares sold to investors than should legally exist. Furthermore entities that have sold such imaginary shares will be bought back in a short squeeze.

            <p>This effect is believed to be large enough that the investors have given this the name MOASS or mother of all short squeezes. Looking for proof of dirty dealings, different methods have been tried, and the current thinking is that all shares sold to investors must be accounted for.  The only known method to do so is to Directly Register Shares. Since the official number of shares issued is known, this countdown is my expected time until the shares are accounted for. At such a time investment will have made a good return. If you're reading this. Gamestop has not yet mooned! </p>
            <p>It's time to update things. When  I first created this on March 24, 2022, there were the equivalent of 40,418,400 shares registered As of Sept 15, 2022 there are 82,654,640 Shares DRS'd Last check we were registering 6 million shares a month and now we're registering 8 million shares a month.</p>
            <br> March 24 we registered 4 million a month 
            <br> May 2 we registered 4 million every 20 Days 
            <br> June 29 it was 4 million every 19 Days 
            <br> August 19 it's 4 million every 14 Days 
            <br> Sept 15 it's 4 million every 13 days"
            <br> Things have slowed as of Nov 16 it's 4 million every 37 days
